  Provide access to the MSP430 flash memory controller. 
  All flash memory can be read, erased and written (except SEGMENT_A, the LOCK bits are not in the code, for a good reason).
  Flash can only be erased per 512 byte segments (except the 4 special information segments, they are 64 bytes in size)
  
  The same flash locations can be written multiple times with new values, but flash bits can only be reset (from 1 to 0) and cannot
  change to a 1 (you need to flash erase the whole segment)

  functions:
  ~~~~~~~~~~
  erase():  Erase a flash segment, all bytes in the segment will read 0xFF after an erase
 
  read(): Read flash locations (actually just a proxy for memcpy)
 
  write(): Write flash locations (actually just a proxy for memcpy), the same location can be written multiple times, 
  but once a bit is reset, you cannot set it with a subsequent write, you need to flash the complete segment to do so.  
  
  NOTE: you are flashing the program memory, you can modify EVERYTHING (program and data) this is usually not what you want. 
  Be carefull when flashing data. You may use SEG_B to SEG_D for normal use, they should not be filled by the compiler with code
  or static data. If you wish to use main memory without wasting any space, you need to inform the linker NOT to use the required 
  segments. This is done in the linker script (this is not for the faint of heart). 
  
  An alternative approach is to allocate a static variable with a size of AT LEAST 2 SEGMENTS in your program. 
  This makes sure there is at least ONE COMPLETE SEGMENT in this static variable, so there is no colleteral damage when you flash this
  area. You need to find the pointer to the start of the next segment. There is a macro define to do this: SEGPTR(x)
  A example that makes 2 segments available for flashing by allocating 3 segments of constant data:
  
  static const unsigned char flash[3*512] = {0};
  
  Flash segments:     |...SEGMENT-0...|...SEGMENT-1...|...SEGMENT-2...|...SEGMENT-3...|...SEGMENT-4...|...SEGMENT-5...|
  Program output:     |Program code.......|flash[3*512***********************************]|Other data.................|
  Available segments: |-------------------------------|+++++++++++++++|+++++++++++++++|-------------------------------|

  constants:

  SEGMENT_A   // pointer to 64 byte flash segments
  SEGMENT_B
  SEGMENT_C
  SEGMENT_D
  
  Macros:
  ~~~~~~~
  SEGPTR(x)  // Return pointer to first complete segment inside variable
  SEGMENT(n) // Return pointer to start of segment n (n=0..63)

  A example that makes 2 segments available for flashing by allocating 3 segments of constant data:


  Using the example:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  On the launchpad; put the two UART jumpers in HARDWARE SERIAL position (horizontal position) and use the terminal window to connect
  to the board (9600baud). 

  'e' Erase the flash segment
  'w' Write "Hello World" to the flash
  'r' Read the contents of the flash, and print as byte values and characters. stop at the first NULL byte

  - When you program the launchpad and read the flash, a single "0" character should be read (mem contains zero values)
    Writing the flash before you have erased it is not possible (you cannot program OFF bits to ON bits)
  - When you erase the flash, 0xFF values will be read back
  - When you write the flash, "Hello World" will be read back
