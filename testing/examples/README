Arduino test result format


The Arduino test result format is based on the need for a result that can be streamed, sumary data is at the end of the test, and is human readable.

Test result format description.

The file begins with info data. It's indicated by having "info." at the begging of the line.
Common info fields:
info.MANUFACTURER    = Arduino
info.CPU-NAME        = ATmega328P
info.GCC-Version     = 4.3.2
info.AVR-LibC-Ver    = 1.6.4
info.Compiled-date   = Oct  4 2010
info.Test-Suite-Name = general


Followed by test run results.

Test run results format:
name of test (information about test)   ... test result condition

A test has the following test result conditions:
ok
FAIL
ERROR

Test result summary is last and seperated from the test by dashes:
--------------------------

Summary will say:
Ran n test in Secs

Test suite final condition:
OK
FAILED (failures=n)
