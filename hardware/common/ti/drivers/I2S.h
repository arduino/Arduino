 *  @file       I2S.h
 *
 *  @brief      I2S driver interface
 *
 *  The I2S header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/I2S.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  The I2S driver simplifies reading and writing to any of the McASP
 *  peripherals on the board with Receive and Transmit support.
 *  These include blocking, non-blocking, read and write characters on the
 *  McASP peripheral. The board's I2S peripheral and pins must
 *  be configured before initializing the I2S driver. The application
 *  initializes the I2S driver by calling I2S_init() and is then ready to
 *  open a I2S by calling I2S_open() and passing in a I2S parameters data
 *  structure.
 *
 *  The APIs in this driver serve as an interface to a typical OSAL
 *  application. The specific peripheral implementations are responsible to
 *  create all the OSAL specific primitives to allow for thread-safe
 *  operation.
 *
 *  ## Opening the driver #
 *
 *  @code
 *  I2S_Handle      handle;
 *  I2S_Params      params;
 *  I2SCC3200DMA_SerialPinParams customParams;
 *
 *  I2S_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.operationMode                     = I2S_MODE_TX_RX_SYNC;
 *  < Change other params as required >
 *
 *  I2SCC3200DMA_Params_init(&customParams);
 *  < Change custom params as required >
 *  params->customParams = (I2SCC3200DMA_SerialPinParams *)&customParams;
 *
 *  handle = I2S_open(someI2S_configIndexValue, &params);
 *  if (!handle) {
 *      System_printf("I2S did not open");
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## Writing data #
 *
 *  @code
 *  const unsigned char hello[] = "Hello World\n";
 *  const unsigned char hello1[] = "Hello World1\n";
 *  I2S_BufDesc writeBuffer1;
 *  I2S_BufDesc writeBuffer2;
 *  I2S_BufDesc *pDesc = NULL;
 *
 *  writeBuffer1.bufPtr  = &hello;
 *  writeBuffer1.bufSize = sizeof(hello);
 *  writeBuffer2.bufPtr  = &hello1;
 *  writeBuffer2.bufSize = sizeof(hello1);
 *
 *  ret = I2S_write(handle, &writeBuffer1);
 *  ret = I2S_write(handle, &writeBuffer2);
 *
 *  while(1)
 *  {
 *      ret = I2S_writeReclaim(handle, &pDesc);
 *      System_printf("The I2S wrote %d bytes\n", ret);
 *      pDesc->bufPtr  = &hello;;
 *      pDesc->bufSize = sizeof(hello);
 *      ret = I2S_write(handle, pDesc);
 *  }
 *
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## Reading data #
 *
 *  @code
 *  unsigned char rxBuffer[20];
 *  unsigned char rxBuffer1[20];
 *  I2S_BufDesc readBuffer1;
 *  I2S_BufDesc readBuffer2;
 *  I2S_BufDesc *pDesc = NULL;
 *
 *  readBuffer1.bufPtr = &rxBuffer;
 *  readBuffer1.bufSize = 20;
 *  readBuffer2.bufPtr = &rxBuffer1;
 *  readBuffer2.bufSize = 20;
 *
 *  ret = I2S_read(handle, &readBuffer1);
 *  ret = I2S_read(handle, &readBuffer2);
 *
 *  while(1)
 *  {
 *      ret = I2S_readReclaim(handle, &pDesc);
 *      System_printf("The I2S read %d bytes\n", ret);
 *      pDesc->bufPtr = &rxBuffer;
 *      pDesc->bufSize = 20;
 *      ret = I2S_read(handle, pDesc);
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for OSAL
 *  applications. Its purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific
 *  peripheral implementations which are specified using a pointer to a
 *  I2S_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The I2S driver interface module is joined (at link time) to a
 *  NULL-terminated array of I2S_Config data structures named *I2S_config*.
 *  *I2S_config* is implemented in the application with each entry being an
 *  instance of a I2S peripheral. Each entry in *I2S_config* contains a:
 *  - (I2S_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement a I2S peripheral
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the I2S_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated to the I2S_FxnTable
 *
 *  Currently the following I2S peripheral implementations are supported:
 *  - @ref I2SCC3200DMA.h
