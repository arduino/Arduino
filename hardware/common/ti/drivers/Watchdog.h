 *
 *  @brief      Watchdog driver interface
 *
 *  The Watchdog header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/Watchdog.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *
 *  The Watchdog driver simplifies configuring and starting the Watchdog
 *  peripherals. The Watchdog can be set up to produce a reset signal after a
 *  timeout, or simply cause a hardware interrupt at a programmable interval.
 *  The driver provides the ability to specify a callback function that is
 *  called when the Watchdog causes an interrupt.
 *
 *  When resets are turned on, it is the user application's responsibility to
 *  call Watchdog_clear() in order to clear the Watchdog and prevent a reset.
 *  Watchdog_clear() can be called at any time.
 *
 *  The Watchdog driver does not configure the board peripherals. This must be
 *  done before any calls to the Watchdog driver. The examples include a
 *  board-specific *Board_initWatchdog()* functions in the board .c and .h
 *  files.
 *
 *  ## Opening the driver #
 *
 *  @code
 *  Watchdog_Handle     handle;
 *  Watchdog_Params     params;
 *
 *  Watchdog_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.resetMode = Watchdog_RESET_OFF;
 *  handle = Watchdog_open(Watchdog_configIndex, &params);
 *  if (!handle) {
 *      System_printf("Watchdog did not open");
 *  }
 *
 *  // handle may now be used to interact with the Watchdog just created
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for TI-RTOS
 *  applications. Its purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific
 *  peripheral implementations which are specified using a pointer to a
 *  Watchdog_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The Watchdog driver interface module is joined (at link time)
 *  to a NULL-terminated array of Watchdog_Config data structures named
 *  *Watchdog_config*. *Watchdog_config* is implemented in the application with
 *  each entry being an instance of a Watchdog peripheral. Each entry in
 *  *Watchdog_config* contains a:
 *  - (Watchdog_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement a Watchdog
 *    peripheral
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the Watchdog_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated to the Watchdog_FxnTable
 *
 *  Currently the following Watchdog implementations are supported:
 *  - @ref WatchdogCC3200.h
 *  - @ref WatchdogMSP430.h
 *  - @ref WatchdogMSP432.h
 *  - @ref WatchdogTiva.h
 *
 *  # Instrumentation #
 *
 *  The Watchdog driver interface produces log statements if
 *  instrumentation is enabled.
 *
 *  Diagnostics Mask | Log details |
