 *
 *  @brief      Clock interface for the RTOS Porting Interface
 *
 *  The ClockP module can be used to schedule functions that run at intervals
 *  specified in the underlying kernel's system ticks.  ClockP instances are
 *  one-shot.  The one-shot function will be run once
 *  after the specified period has elapsed since calling ClockP_start().
 *
 *  The ClockP module can also be used to obtain the period of the kernel's
 *  system tick in microseconds.  This is useful for determining the number of
 *  ticks needed for setting a Clock object's period.
 *
 *  When using the TI-RTOS kernel, ClockP functions are run at software
 *  interrupt level. With FreeRTOS, the ClockP functions are run by a timer
 *  service task with priority configured by the application.
 *
 *  A common use case is to post a semaphore in the clock function. There is a
 *  specific API for this: Semaphore_postFromClock(). This must be used in a
 *  clock function (instead of Semaphore_post or Semaphore_postFromISR).
 *
