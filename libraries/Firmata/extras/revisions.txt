FIRMATA 2.4.0 - Dec 21, 2014

Changes from 2.3.6 to 2.4 that may impact existing Firmata client implementations:

* When sending a string from the client application to the board (STRING_DATA) a
static buffer is now used for the incoming string in place of a dynamically allocated
block of memory (see Firmata.cpp lines 181 - 205). In Firmata 2.3.6 and older,
the dynamically allocated block was never freed, causing a memory leak. If your
client library had freed this memory in the string callback method, that code
will break in Firmata 2.4. If the string data needs to persist beyond the string
callback, it should be copied within the string callback.

* As of Firmata 2.4, when digital port reporting or analog pin reporting is enabled,
the value of the port (digital) or pin (analog) is immediately sent back to the client
application. This will likely not have a negative impact on existing client
implementations, but may be unexpected. This feature was added to better support
non-serial streams (such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc) that may lose
connectivity and need a quick way to get the current state of the pins upon
reestablishing a connection.

[core library]
* Changed sendValueAsTwo7bitBytes, startSysex and endSysex from private to
  public methods.
* Added Intel Galileo to Boards.h
* Renamed FirmataSerial to FirmataStream
* Updated to latest Arduino library format
* writePort function in Boards.h now returns 1 (to suppress compiler warning)
* Updated syntax highlighting (keywords.txt)
* Fixed IS_PIN_SPI ifndef condition in boards.h
* Added constants to Firmata.h to reserve configurable firmata features
* Fixed issue where firmwareName was not reported correctly in Windows
* Ensure incoming String via STRING_DATA command is null-terminated
* Fixed memory leak when receiving String via STRING_DATA command
  (note this change may break existing code if you were manually deallocating
  the incoming string in your string callback function. See code for details)
* Added ability for user to specify a filename when calling setFirmwareNameAndVersion
* Increased input data buffer size from 32 to 64 bytes

[StandardFirmata]
* Updated I2C_READ_CONTINUOUSLY to work with or without slaveRegister (Rick Waldron)
* Added Yun variant of StandardFirmata
* When a digital port is enabled, its value is now immediately sent to the client
* When an analog pin is enabled, its value is now immediately sent to the client
* Changed the way servo pins are mapped to enable use of servos on
  a wider range of pins, including analog pins.
* Fixed management of unexpected sized I2C replies (Nahuel Greco)
* Fixed a bug when removing a monitored device with I2C_STOP_Reading (Nahuel Greco)
* Fixed conditional expression in I2C_STOP_READING case
* Changed samplingInterval from type int to type unsigned int
* Shortened error message strings to save a few bytes

[examples]
* Updated FirmataServo example to use new pin mapping technique
* Removed makefiles from examples (because they were not being updated)
* Updated all examples to set current firmware version
